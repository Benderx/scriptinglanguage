# scriptinglanguage

C++ - A very basic scripting language that can be interacted with through the terminal. Written as a project for one of my Computer Science classes at Penn State.

You can save functions and variables, and then execute commands. Evaluates expressions with parenthesis through recursion, and the rest through postfix notation. Stores variables in a binary tree for quick indexing.

Run/edit driver to utilize any prebuilt scripts you wish to enter.
